      <h3>CURRICULUM</h3>
      Code School is an intensive nine-week course for students who are interested in jumpstarting their web programming careers. Interaction with the local industry is facilitated by Code School, and many participants are placed in internships and jobs within the software and web industries upon completing the course.

      Participants will learn modern web technologies, including advanced HTML5 and CSS, JavaScript, databases, frameworks, and client-side and server-side web application development, applied to real-world projects in a concentrated, quick-paced format.

      No DSU credit will be earned for attending Code School, but the knowledge you will gain can make it easier to complete or test-out of related CIT courses. Most importantly, the connections you will make and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.
